### Getting Started

Start by downloading data files from the Portal. Note that the complete CMB-S4 design tool simulations are 600 Gbytes; you may want to start with a subset. We recommend the sample subset available from the Portal. Once downloaded, you may access the files directly using standard tools for the dataset file type.
