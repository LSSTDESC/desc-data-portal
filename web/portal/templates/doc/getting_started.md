### Getting Started

Start by downloading data files from the Portal. Note that the complete DC2 dataset (Object and Truth Match) is about 180 Gbytes and cosmoDC2 is over 5 Tbytes; you may want to start with a subset. We recommend the sample subset available from the Portal. Once downloaded, you may access the files directly using standard tools for the dataset file type.

Alternatively, for a higher-level interface, you may install and configure the Python package GCRCatalogs.

In order to get some experience with the data we have provided Jupyter notebooks for each dataset. GCRCatalogs is required in order to run them.
