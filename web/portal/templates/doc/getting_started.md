### Getting Started

Start by downloading data files from the Portal. Note that the complete dataset is about 180 Gbytes; you may want to start with a subset. We recommend the sample subset required by the tutorial notebooks. At this point you may access the files directly using standard Parquet tools.

Alternatively, for a higher-level interface, you may install and configure the Python package GCRCatalogs.

In order to get some experience with the data we have provided a pair of Jupyter notebooks. GCRCatalogs is required in order to run them.
