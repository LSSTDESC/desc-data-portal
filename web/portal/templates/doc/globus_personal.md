## Set up [Globus Personal Connect](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal)

Your Globus account may grant you access to various Collections where you can access and transfer data.  You may also want to download directly to your own laptop.
Globus Personal Connect allows you to set up an endpoint on your machine so that you can upload and download data.

To set up Globus Personal Connect

* Visit [https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal)
* Choose the installation for your machine and follow Globus' detailed instructions.

Once your personal endpoint is set up, you can choose that as your destination for any transfer initiated by the LSSTDESC Data Portal or any Globus transfer.
